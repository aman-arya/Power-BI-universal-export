**Overview**

Universal Export is a garments manufacturing company from Southampton, UK. It manufactures various types of plain, unmarked, unlabelled clothing for retailers, wholesalers, and others such as t-shirts, hoodies, jackets, etc. Retailers purchase blank garments from Universal Export and put on their logo or design before selling them at a markup price. 

The task is to prepare two different reports for two different audiences:
1) External-facing report that provides an overview of business operation in 2023 for shareholders: In this, a data visualisation report using data from Universal Exportâ€™s operation in 2023 needs to be generated that provides shareholders with a clear understanding of the company's operational overall status. This report is provided yearly to shareholders of the company and is intended for shareholders with various levels of knowledge of the company to gain an insight into their investment. 
In particular, the following is key information that needs to be presented to the shareholders to communicate the company's situation:
   - An understanding of the sales and profit of Universal Expert in 2023, both as an overview snapshot of the whole period and a pattern of change across the year by weeks and months.
   - Insight into various types of products that the company produced and sold. There should be an emphasis on establishing products that are clear strengths and weaknesses of the company to shareholders.
   - Comparative sales performance across various countries. 
   - As part of the sustainable commitment, the company has committed to reducing the use of exclusive air shipment from the 1st of July 2023 onward to the end of 2023. The result of this goal must be provided to shareholders.

2) Internal-facing report on salespeople performance: A data visualisation report that provides the management team with insight into the performance of salespeople within the company. They would like to gain an understanding of various individual salespeople across various key criteria of evaluation as part of a process to determine promotion to head and deputy head of the sales department. In particular, the following information, according to management, are key factors in their promotion process:
   - Sales and profits that each of them has generated with profit being more important.
   - Ability to acquire new customers in 2023.
   - Demonstrate understanding of company margin through a focus on profitable products.
